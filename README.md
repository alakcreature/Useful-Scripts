1. Sometimes my mouse touchpad not works, so that i have added two lines in the above scripts so that it can unmount the touchpad driver and will reload it. Almost everytime, it fixes my issue. Hooe it works in the same way for you also.

2. This script is for setting up ssh-key in your ubuntu system so that it can communicate git throught ssh.
